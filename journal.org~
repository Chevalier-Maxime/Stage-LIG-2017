***** Emacs shortcuts
Here are a few convenient emacs shortcuts for those that have never
used emacs. In all of the emacs shortcuts, =C=Ctrl=, =M=Alt/Esc= and
=S=Shift=.  Note that you may want to use two hours to follow the emacs
tutorial (=C-h t=). In the configuration file CUA keys have been
activated and allow you to use classical copy/paste (=C-c/C-v=)
shortcuts. This can be changed from the Options menu.
  - =C-x C-c= exit
  - =C-x C-s= save buffer
  - =C-g= panic mode ;) type this whenever you want to exit an awful
    series of shortcuts
  - =C-Space= start selection marker although selection with shift and
    arrows should work as well
  - =C-l= reposition the screen
  - =C-_= (or =C-z= if CUA keys have been activated)
  - =C-s= search
  - =M-%= replace
  - =C-x C-h= get the list of emacs shortcuts
  - =C-c C-h= get the list of emacs shortcuts considering the mode you are
    currently using (e.g., C, Lisp, org, ...)
  There are a bunch of cheatsheets also available out there (e.g.,
  [[http://www.shortcutworld.com/en/linux/Emacs_23.2.1.html][this one for emacs]] and [[http://orgmode.org/orgcard.txt][this one for org-mode]] or this [[http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs-v2-Large.png][graphical one]]).
***** Org-mode                                                  :OrgMode:
  Many emacs shortcuts start by =C-x=. Org-mode's shortcuts generaly
  start with =C-c=.
  - =Tab= fold/unfold
  - =C-c c= capture (finish capturing with =C-c C-c=, this is explained on
    the top of the buffer that just opened)
  - =C-c C-c= do something useful here (tag, execute, ...)
  - =C-c C-o= open link
  - =C-c C-t= switch todo
  - =C-c C-e= export
  - =M-Enter= new item/section
  - =C-c a= agenda (try the =L= option)
  - =C-c C-a= attach files
  - =C-c C-d= set a deadl1ine (use =S-arrows= to navigate in the dates)
  - =A-arrows= move subtree (add shift for the whole subtree)
***** Org-mode Babel (for literate programming)                 :OrgMode:
  - =<s + tab= template for source bloc. You can easily adapt it to get this:
      : #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      : ls
      : #+END_SRC
    Now if you =C-c C-c=, it will execute the block.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+RESULTS:
  | #journal.org# |
  | journal.html  |
  | journal.org   |
  | journal.org~  |
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  
  - Source blocks have many options (formatting, arguments, names,
    sessions,...), which is why I have my own shortcuts =<b + tab= bash
    block (or =B= for sessions).
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
  #+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  ls /tmp/*201*.pdf
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : /tmp/2015_02_bordeaux_otl_tutorial.pdf
  : /tmp/2015-ASPLOS.pdf
  : /tmp/2015-Europar-Threadmap.pdf
  : /tmp/europar2016-1.pdf
  : /tmp/europar2016.pdf
  : /tmp/M2-PDES-planning-examens-janvier2016.pdf
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - I have defined many such templates in my configuration. You can
    give a try to =<r=, =<R=, =<RR=, =<g=, =<p=, =<P=, =<m= ...
  - Some of these templates are not specific to babel: e.g., =<h=, =<l=,
    =<L=, =<c=, =<e=, ...
***** In case you want to play with ipython on a recent debian   :Python:
Here is what you should install:
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
sudo apt-get install python3-pip ipython3 ipython3-notebook python3-numpy python3-matplotlib
#+end_src

The ipython notebook can then be run with the following command:
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
ipython3 notebook
#+end_src

The latest version of this notebook is called [[http://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] and is polyglot
like babel. Playing with it is easy as it's deployed on the cloud but
as I'm not a python expert I'm not sure to know how to deploy it locally.
***** In case you want to play with R/knitR/rstudio:                  :R:
Here is what you should install on debian:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install r-base r-cran-ggplot2
#+END_SRC

Rstudio and knitr are unfortunately not packaged within debian so the
easiest is to download the corresponding debian package on the [[http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop][Rstudio
webpage]] and then to install it manually (depending on when you do
this, you can obviously change the version number).
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.99.887-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-0.99.887-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -f install # to fix possibly missing dependencies
#+END_SRC
You will also need to install knitr. To this end, you should simply
run R (or Rstudio) and use the following command.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("knitr")
#+END_SRC
If =r-cran-ggplot2= could not be installed for some reason, you can also
install it through R by doing:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("ggplot2")
#+END_SRC

As you will experience, knitr is polyglot but not Rstudio, which
makes its use not as fluid when using other languages than R.
